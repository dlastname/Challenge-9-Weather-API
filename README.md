# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard application allows users to search for cities and view current and 5-day forecast weather conditions, leveraging the OpenWeather API. The application features a search history, displaying previously searched cities and allowing users to click on them for quick access to weather data. The backend stores city names and their weather data in a `searchHistory.json` file, while the frontend presents the weather information in a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

Feel free to clone the application to your machine, however this is already deployed on a router workspace.\

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Use the search bar to enter a city name.
3. View the current weather and 5-day forecast for the selected city.
4. The search history will be displayed, allowing you to click on past cities to quickly view their weather data again.
